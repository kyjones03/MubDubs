- 👋 Hi, I’m @kyjones03
- 👀 I have a high interest in small projects within Python and Node JS for Azure centric workloads.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure Bicep and building repositories to be used for Proof-of-Concepts, Demos, and Production deployments.
- 💞️ I am open to collaborating on Azure based projects.
