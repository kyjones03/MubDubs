- 👋 Hi, I’m @kyjones03
- 👀 I have an interest in building infrastructure as code and automating deployments to Microsoft Azure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure Bicep and building repositories to be used for Proof-of-Concepts, Demos, and Production deployments.
- 💞️ I am open to collaborating on Azure based projects.
